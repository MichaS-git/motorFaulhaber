This driver supports the Faulhaber MCDC2805 servo controller.

It assumes the following wiring:
   Analog input = Input 1 = Home input
   Fault pin =    Input 2 = CW limit
   Input 3        Input 3 = CCW limit

There is a currently a problem with the Home input, and its status cannot be read.  The reason for this
is being investigated, but until it is resolved the home functions in the motor record do not work.

The following commands are send to the MCDC2805 when the EPICS software initializes:

/* Set the velocity control to be RS-232 */
SOR 0

/* Program fault pin as limit switch input */
REFIN

/* Program limit polarity for rising edge and high level */
HP7

/* Program the motor to hard block on the the limit switch inputs */
HB6
           
/* Program the limit switch directions to block
 * + direction on input 2, - direction on input 3 */
HD2
           
/* Program homing sequence on input 1*/
HL1
HA1
CAHOSEQ

It is a good idea to set the power-up behavior of the device to be "disabled" by sending the following
commands once:
DI
EEPSAV

It is also necessary to change the address of the board from the default address of 0 if daisy chaining 
multiple modules.  To change to address 1, send the following commands once:

NODEADR 1
EEPSAV

This driver supports the Faulhaber MCBL2805 servo controller. It was written to control a "Guidance 
with air-beared slides LL-S" from jfa:
https://www.jfa.de/en/produkte/p/53/guidances-with-air-beared-slides-ll-s/

It assumes, that the following settings are already saved in the EEprom:
